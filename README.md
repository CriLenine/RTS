# RTS

Project developed with a team of four students (including me) within 10 weeks, this is a 2D multiplayer Real-Time Strategy game. It can also be played in solo against a basic AI.

# My contribution

I mainly worked on the resources managment / harvesting, as well as on the QuadTree to optimize character moves.

# Known issues

When playing against AI or with a low-performance device, the game quickly begins to lag and some latency is experienced.
